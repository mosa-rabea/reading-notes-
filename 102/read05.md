# **comparison operators.**
## **its a way used in java script to compare one value in the script to what you expect it might be ,and the result of comparison operation is  boolean (true or fase).**

| symbol          | meaning                                                      |
| -----------     | -----------                                                  |
| ==              | comparing two values                                         |
| !=              | is not equal                                                 |
| ===             | compare two values and their datatypes                       |
| !==             | strict not equal (check the value and datatype)              |
|<                | less than                                                    |
|>                | greater than                                                 |
|<=                | less than or equal                                          |
|>=                | greater than or equal                                       |



## **logical operators allow you to compare that results of more than one comparison operator.**

| logical symbol          | meaning                                                               |
| -----------             | -----------                                                           |
| &&                      | And (the two expressions must be true to give an answer as true)      |
|\|\|                     | Or (one of the expressions must be true to give an answer as true)    |
| !                       | Not (changes true to fase , and changes false to true)                |



# **loops.**
## **loops check a condition , if it returns true then the code block will run, but if it returns false the loop will end .**
## **types of loops:**
1. ## **for :the most common loop , used if you want to run a code with specific number of times.**
2. ## **while :use it if you dont know how many times the code should run , you will provide a condition and the code will still running if the condition is still true .**
3. ## **do while : same as while condition but it will run the code inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false .**

## **loop counter is made up of three statements:**
1. ## **initialization :create a varriable commonly we use (i) as a name.**
2. ## **condition :you will put a specific number which the loop will continue untill the counter reachs this number.**
3. ## **update : every time the loop run the statement in curly braces , add one to the counter.**
