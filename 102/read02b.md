# version control
## version control : is a way to revisit an older version of a file or a set of files by recording the changes that happening to the file all the time so if something went wrong you can go back to the previous version of that file , there are many types of version control like:

## 1- local version control (vcs) :in this type the version control system will store the data in your local hard disk .
## 2- centralized version control system (cvcs) :the same idea as the first but the data will be stored in a server and this type gives the adminstrator more control on the work.
## 3- distributed version control system (dvcs) :this type was invented because the second type have problems if the server where the database stored has stopped working , it allows for multiple mirrors repositories so you can keep working on a file .

# git
## git : is (dvcs) store data in way that everytime you make changes to the file it will take a snapshot of the changes and store it .
## files in get reside in three states : 
## 1-committed : data stored in local database.
## 2-modified    : changed happened but still not committed to database.
## 3-staged        : flaged a file changed version to committed it in next snapshot .

## files can be tracked or untracked , tracked means the files were in the last snapshot , the untracked means the files were not in the last snapshot .

## to start using get you have to install it on your computer first , you can install git by install it as a package or you can download it's source code and compile it.
## for windows users you can install git as apart of github through this link http://windows.github.com (Links to an external site.) .
## by default git use the system's text editor unless you change that using some commands .

## git also has a feature called remote repositories and that allows the team to push informations and pull date from the repositories .
