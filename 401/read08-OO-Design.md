# Don't repeat yourself :

* ### is away in programming language ,
### that i will create Class to inherit from it or Schema ,
###  in that way i don't rewrite a same code every time i need it ,
###  and in this way my project be clear .

# Rule of three (computer programming) :

* ###  is a code refactoring rule of thumb ,
###  to decide when you are write same code two times ,
###  to void duplication .

* ###  if you used same code three time ,you should write a code in new procedure .

# You aren't gonna need it :

* ###  if you don't need this function then don't write it .

* ###  Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

# Minimum viable product :

* ###  you need to avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work.
