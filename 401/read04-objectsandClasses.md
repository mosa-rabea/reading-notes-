# Objects and Classes


## benefits of bundling the code into individual objects:

* Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your  application and plug in a different object as its replacement.

* Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently.

* Information-hiding: the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.

* ## objects are everything which have a state and behavior.



## classes are the blueprint or template which make the objects.


* This is a class declaration.
 The class body (the area between the braces)
  contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.


## variables are three kinds:
* Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
* Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
* Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.


## class declarations can include these components:
* Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later.
* The class name .
* The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends.
* A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements.
* The class body, surrounded by braces {}.

# Decimals

* Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller.

* decimal number system it also called big10 system , because it based on number 10.



## methods declaration components:

* An exception list—to be discussed later.
* The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, including the declaration of local variables, goes here.
* The method name—the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
* The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types, enclosed by parentheses, (). If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.


* when it comes to naming a method we use the cammel case rule, and in the same class you can give methods the same name as long as they have different parameter list.
