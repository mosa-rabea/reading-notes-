# Application Fundamentals :

* you can write android app using this languages : Kotlin, Java, and C++ .

* Android package: its the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

* Android App Bundle : is a publishing format and is not installable on Android devices, it defers APK generation and signing to a later stage.

* ### Android security features: 

* every Android operating system has a multi-user Linux system.

* The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.

* app's code runs in isolation from other apps. 

* On Android, the app uses only the data it needs.

* It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID. 

* The application asks you for permission to access some information such as bluetooth, location, etc.

* The core framework components that define your app.

* The manifest file in which you declare the components and the required device features for your app.

* Resources that are separate from the app code and that allow your app to gracefully optimize its behavior for a variety of device configurations.

- type app components :

* Activities : Activities	They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smart phone screen
* Services : They handle background processing associated with an application.
* Broadcast receivers : They handle communication between Android OS and applications.
