# Graphs :

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. 
The nodes are sometimes also referred toas vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

# why i need Graphs :


Graphs are a common method to visually illustrate relationships in the data. 
The purpose of a graph is to present data that are too numerous or complicated 
to be described adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however,
use graphs for small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.

### Terminology

1. Vertex : also called a “node”, a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge : a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes.
4. Degree : the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Undirected Graphs

> Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

### Directed Graphs (Digraph)

 Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.






### Weighted Graphs
> A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.


### examples of graphs in use:

1. GPS and Mapping
2. Driving Directions
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
