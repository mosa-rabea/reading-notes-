## Who is Roy Fielding?
+ ## He is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. 


## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
+ ## Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.


## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
+ ## its all about applying verbs to nouns.

## What does a GET do?
+ ## retrieve information using a simple HTTP GET.

## What does a POST do?
+ ## add something use an HTTP verb of POST. 

## What does PUT do?
+ ## replace something uses an HTTP verb of PUT,

## What does PATCH do?
+ ## to do a partial update use PATCH.
