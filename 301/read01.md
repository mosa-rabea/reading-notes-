# component
## A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

## A component can have three views:
1. ## object oriented view.
2. ## conventional view.
3. ## process related view.

## there are many characteristics of components such as:
+ ## reusability: components are designed to be reused.
+ ## replaceable: components can be replaced with other similar components.
+ ## not context specific: Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
+ ## extensible: can be extended from existing component to provide a new behavior.
+ ## encapsulated: a component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality.
+ ## independent: Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## advantages of using component architecture:
+ ## ease of deployment.
+ ## reduse cost.
+ ## ease of development.
+ ## reusable.
+ ## modification of technical complexilty.
+ ## reliability.
+ ## system maintenance.
+ ## independency.

# props.
## props is stands for properties and its a special keyword in react, its being used for passing data from one component to another.

## the data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (from parent to a child).

## props data are read only (the data coming from the parent cant be changed from the child).

## Props are being passed to components like function arguments.
