# SQL vs NoSQL


## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL                    | NoSQL                                  |
| -----------            | -----------                            |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.   |
|  table based databases                 | document based                |
|  have predefined schema                 | have dynamic schema for unstructured data.               |
| vertically scalable                  | horizontally scalable               |
| SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data |  queries are focused on collection of documentsmd)                |


## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
+ ## non hierarchical data, heavy duty transactional type applications.


## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
+ ##  hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
+ ## NoSQL.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
+ ## SQL.


## What does SQL stand for?
+ ## Structured Query Language.

## What is a realational database?
+ ## a database works in a certain way and support sq language.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
+ ## tables


## What is a NoSQL database?
+ ## NoSQL databases are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables.

## How does it work?
+ ## key value pair.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
+ ## sql is more flexible.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
