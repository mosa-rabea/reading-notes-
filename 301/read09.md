# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING


## What is functional programming?
+ ## it is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.


## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
+ ## It returns the same result if given the same arguments
+ ## It does not cause any observable side effects.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
+ ## easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.

## What is immutability?
+ ## Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

## What is Referential transparency?
+ ## when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.


## What is a module?
+ ## it's how we split our code, we creat a new module (js file) for every certain functionality of the code.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?
+ ## ewquire is used when we want to use a functionality from a module inside another module we import it by using the require.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
+ ## by using require :  require(./path) .

## What do we have to do to make a module available?
+ ## we use:  module.export = name;
