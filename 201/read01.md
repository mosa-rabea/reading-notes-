## *if you want to build a good website there are alot of things you have to put in consideration, things like:*
+ ## *who is this site for (target audience).*
+ ## *their age.*
+ ## *their backgrounds.*
+ ## *their level of education.*
## *the next step after you knew your website audience, you should give them the kind of information they are looking for. the right kind of information which suits their needs is a very important thing to offer in your website.*

## *the visual design of the website is very important thing because its organizing the information and prioritizing them. one of the good ways to differentiate between information is using size, color , and style.you can also use grouping to simplify the information.*

# *javascript*
## *javascript is a programming laguage which used to make the websites more interactive and user-friendly, but before you can learn how to read and write javascript codes you need to understand what script means.*
## *script: is a series of instructions that a computer follow to achieve a goal.*
## *writing a script is a flowchart process first you have to state a goal then you start listing the tasks that need to be completed to achieve that goal, so if you made a good flowchart you will have a good script.*

## *In computer programming, we use objects to represent physical things.*
## *Methods typically represent how people interact with an object in the real world.*
## *Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object are all related to each other: Events trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.*
## *to use javascript in a webpage we have two ways:*
1. ## *writing your javascript code inside your html by using \<script> \</script> element and write the script between them.*
2. ## *writing your javascript code in an external file and link it to your html by using \<script src="your script file path">\</script>.*
## *javascript runs where it is found in the html. the most common location to link the javascript in an html page is in the end of the body section.*
