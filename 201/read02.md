# *CSS*
+ ## *css works as if there is a box around every html element.*
## *we use css to creat rules that control the way that html is presented, and these rules are consist of two parts:*
1. ## *selector: indicates which element the rule applies to.*
2. ## *declaration: indecates how the element should be styled.*
## *we use css in two ways:*
1. ## *internal css inside the html code page.*
2. ## *in an external css file and we link it to the html by using this tag \<link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /> inside the head.*
