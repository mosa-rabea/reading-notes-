# *Objects*
+ > ## *Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names. ~from book: javascript_and_jquery_interactive_jon_du*
+ ## *in object, variables called properties, and functions called methods.*
+ ## *there are several ways to creat an object, the most common one called literal notation.*
+ ## *you can access properties or methods of an object using dot notation, and you can access the prooerties only using square brackets syntax.*

# *Document Object Model*
+ ## *The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page.*
+ ## *The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.*
## *dom covers two primary areas:*
1. ## *making a model of html.*
2. ## *accessing and changing the html page.*
## *DOM trees have four types of nodes:*
1. ## *document nodes.*
2. ## *element nodes.*
3. ## *attribute nodes.*
4. ## *and text nodes.*
+ ## *the methods which find elements in the doom tree are called DOM queries.*
+ ## *if you need to use the same element more than once , you can store the location of the element in a variable, just the location of the element not the element itself.*
+ ## *You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.*
+ ## *DOM queries may return one element or a nodelist.*
