# *html lists*
## *in html there are several ways to do a list:*
+ ## *ordered list: is a list where every item is numbered \<ol> \</ol>.*
+ ## *unordered list: is a list where every item begins with a bullet point \<ul>\</ul>.*
+ ## *definition list:  are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms \<dl>\<dt>\<dd>\</dd>\</dt>\</dl>.*
## *nested list: is when you put a second list inside the \<li>.*

# *boxes*
## *as we know the css treat the web page elements as boxes.*
## *you can change the hight and wedth of every box*
+ ## *min-width and max-width: Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.*
+ ## *min-height and max-height: same idea of min and max width but for the height.*
+ ## *overflow: tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself, it has two values:*
1. ## *hidden: hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.*
2. ## *scroll: adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.*

## *Every box has three properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:*
1. ## *border*
2. ## *margin*
3. ## *padding*

# *ARRAYS*
## *its a special kind of variables which can store more than one value, it store values in a list.*
## *creating array is like creating a variable you just declare it by using var and the array name , but when you asign the values you asign them in a square brackets and each value is separated by comma.*
## *values inside an array accessed as if they stored in a numbered list, and the numbering in array list starts from zero and its called the index number.*

# *switch*
## *switch statement is a condition statement where you write switch and you write a value then start check it in cases.*

# *loops*
## *loops check a condition , if it returns true then the code block will run, but if it returns false the loop will end.*
## *there are three types of loops in javascript:*
1. ## *for :the most common loop , used if you want to run a code with specific number of times.*
2. ## *while :use it if you dont know how many times the code should run , you will provide a condition and the code will still running if the condition is still true.*
3. ## *do while : same as while condition but it will run the code inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false.*

## *loop counter is made up of three statements:*
1. ## *initialization: create a varriable commonly we use (i) as a name.*
2. ## *condition: you will put a specific number which the loop will continue untill the counter reachs this number.*
3. ## *update: every time the loop run the statement in curly braces , add one to the counter.*
