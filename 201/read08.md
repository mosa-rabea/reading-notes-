# *layout*
## *as we learned earlier that css treats html elements as boxes, there are two types of these boxes:*
1. ## *block level box: start always on a new line.*
2. ## *inline box: flow between surrounding text.*

## *Containing Elements: when a block level element sits inside another block level element, the outer one known as the containing or parent element.*
## *there are more than one type to define the position in css:*
+ ## *Normal flow (static)*
+ ## *Relative Positioning*
+ ## *Absolute positioning*
+ ## *Fixed Positioning*
+ ## *Floating Elements*
## *Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.*


# *screen resolution*
## *screen resolution: is the number of dots a screen shows per inch.*

## *Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.*
