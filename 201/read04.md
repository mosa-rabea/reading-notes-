# *links*
## *links is a very important feature in html because it allow us to move from a page to another.*
## *how to use links:*
+ ## *you can use link feature in html by using \<a> element then you put the url using the 'href' attribute for example: \<a href="url">any text\</a>.*
+ ## *if you want to link to an email you can use this: \<a href="name@example.com">any text\</a>.*
+ ## *if you want the link to open in new window use this: \<a href="url" target="_blank">any text\</a>*.
+ ## *if you want to link to a specific part in the same page use the id like this: \<a href="#id">any text\</a>.*

# *layout*
## *as we learned earlier that css treats html elements as boxes, there are two types of these boxes:*
1. ## *block level box: start always on a new line.*
2. ## *inline box: flow between surrounding text.*

# *functions*
## *functions: series of statement that have been grouped together because they perform a specific tast.*
## *methods: are similer to functions except they are created inside the object.*
## *variable scopes:*
+ ## *local variable: is a variable created inside a function, this variable cant be used outside the function.*
+ ## *global variable: is a variable created outside the function, this variable can be used indside and out side the function.*
## *global variables use more memory than local variables because The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only membered during the period of time that a function is being executed.*

# *pair programming*
## *pair programming: the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.*
## *pair programming involves two roles:*
1. ## *the driver: the programmer who is typing the code.*
